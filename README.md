### Yet another Electroblob's Wizardry spell pack.. this time bringing many bits and pieces of support for various mods!

**This mod requires the [Electroblob's Wizardry mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/electroblobs-wizardry) .**


### What is this mod?

Spell Bundle materializes a very simple idea - I wanted to create new Electroblob's Wizardry spells, artefacts, and other cool magical stuff for my favorite mods - all of them being fully optional!

For quite a few mods, this would only mean a very few new spells, which wouldn't be worth an entire dedicated ("Electroblob's Wizardry spell pack") mod. Spell Bundle aims to add support for these mods.

If you'd like to suggest candidate mods for support, get in touch via the Discord server.

### For the list of currently supported mods, see the [mod's CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/spell-bundle)!
